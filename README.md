# Jokes integration

This is the simplest but somewhat useful and funny integration I could think of. It even doesn't use a single entity, just one state returning a string.

Every Minute, a sensor provides a joke. Done.

## Why

This component exists to develop, test and show my dev container.
https://github.com/LaggAt/ha-devcontainer

## Progess

Component is working. Next is adding the dev container around it.

## Sponsor

If the devcontainer or this integration is of some use for you, buy me a coffee:

Thank you!
